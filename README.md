# WinUI3_Direct2D_Effects

Test most of Direct2D [Built-in Effects](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct2d/built-in-effects) in WinUI 3 
and a few transitions animations using some effects (tested on Windows 10 22H2, Windows App SDK 1.4, 1.7.250401001)

Effects use an Image control (by converting ID2D1Bitmap to BitmapImage), animations a SwapChainPanel control
